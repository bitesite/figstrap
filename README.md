# FigStrap

A front-end framework that helps bridge the gap between designers who use Figma and developers.

## Features

### Auto-layout

One of the key features of Figma is the ability to automatically layout elements using "auto layout". Auto-layout sets a flow direction (horizontal, vertical), sets up a gap (or margin in CSS speak between elements), and a few other properties. FigStrap has some utility classes to easily follow the Figma flow.
